# Template for Overleaf
 A LaTeX Template for Economics Papers

This GitHub Project is meant to provide a dummy template for Overleaf. There is
nothing fancy here, but the files are all set up and should compile out of the
box. The code makes it clear how to create two-panel figures and also how to 
properly format the title page.
